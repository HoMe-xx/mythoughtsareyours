title: "So damn gentle with everything."

I have to be so damn gentle with everything. How much tension builds up when one has to go through the world knowing if they’re not too careful. “You will have everything shatter into a million pieces!” Life is so fragile. If it wasn’t perfectly balance we would not be here. Then again you might say that there is a room for error, but compared to the cosmos this margin for error is miniscule. I am here, now. I need to break through the limiter that stresses my brain. It’s not their fault for what I am. I am what I am.
