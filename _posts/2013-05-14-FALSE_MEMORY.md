During my 18th year on this earth the culmination of my years of deep depression had finally taken itâ€™s toll. The decision was made to end my own life. My attempt would have succeeded if it was not intervened by a stranger. A few weeks in intensive in patient therapy and years of different medications later, I have become a different entity all together. I am very lucky to have not succeeded as I believe my life is more fulfilled now than it ever was before.
