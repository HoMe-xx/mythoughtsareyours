title: "Reality, and my grip becoming lose."
---

Reality is becoming more and more like a dream each day. What I feel in life is just as bland and unfeeling as in a dream… I fear I am losing lucidity. Reality is getting harder to distinguish from my dreams. I lay here and think. I think and wonder, “Am I a self-conscious being or an animal that survives on instincts?” An animal of highly-compacted intelligence which survives on instinct could be perceived as a conscious being. I lay here unaware of time passing by. It all seems the same. Where is my life, no where is reality going?
