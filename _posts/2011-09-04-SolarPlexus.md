title: "Solar Plexus"

The third eye, solar plexus, what a wonderful thing. It is the only thing that recently gave me a totally different experience. It started at the plexus, and travelled through my brain right down to the tail of my spine. When un-merged from the water I felt a euphoria and my muscles relaxed. Am I stressed? Who knows.
