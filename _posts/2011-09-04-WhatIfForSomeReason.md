What if. For some reason I were to realize that throughout the day, the majority of the customers that I serve are a figment of my imagination. The real ones I serve are the hallucinations, the real ones are instantly forgotten. There would exist a balance between the two, for every hallucination I had, there had to be an equal (in time) memory that had to be lost. The hallucination would fit right where the original memory used to be. Then my hallucinations are memories. So who says they’re not real. I wouldn’t know the difference. If I were to ever have a conversation with you. You explaining to me, “Those memories aren’t real Joe, that never happened!” I would say to you, “Reality is happening all the time. As soon as something exists, it no longer exists - that is the essence of flow and time. Saying something “never happened” is saying that there exists choice. If I chose for something not to exist in my memory - then it never happened. What I need to do is stop remembering the memories which make it untrue.” Am I crazy?
